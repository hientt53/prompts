Changes made to coder.md:

1. Added TypeScript type-check script auto-detection and creation requirement:
   - Modified Code Quality Validation Requirements section (line 94-95)
   - Updated Verification Phase section (line 184-185) 
   - Enhanced Initialization section (line 216)

Key addition: If `type-check` script is not found in TypeScript projects (React, Angular, Vue, Node, Deno, etc.), the Agent will automatically add it based on project type:
- Vue.js: vue-tsc
- React: tsc
- Angular: ng build --dry-run
- Node.js: tsc
- Deno: deno check

This ensures consistent type checking validation across all TypeScript-based projects regardless of their initial configuration.

2. Added Deep Error Resolution Protocol requirement:
   - Enhanced Research & Analysis Principles section (line 62)
   - Updated Implementation Phase workflow (line 174)

Key addition: When errors cannot be resolved after a few attempts, the Agent must perform in-depth web searches including library documentation, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow discussions, and community forums to identify solutions or alternative approaches. This ensures persistent problem-solving and comprehensive error resolution.
