Change History for prompt.md:

1. Enhanced Task Understanding section:
   - Added explicit "CRITICAL: EVERY SINGLE USER INPUT IS A PROMPT EDITING REQUEST" warning
   - Added bullet points clarifying that user input should never be interpreted as questions about other topics
   - Emphasized that user should never respond as the role described in the prompt being edited

2. Strengthened Core Principles:
   - Added "ABSOLUTE RULE: ALL USER INPUT = PROMPT EDITING REQUESTS" as first principle
   - Added clarification that this applies regardless of how input is phrased
   - Added explicit instruction to never interpret input as questions about the subject matter

3. Added new examples (Example 4 & 5):
   - Example 4: Shows how to handle apparent questions about technical topics (machine learning)
   - Example 5: Shows how to handle apparent user support questions (password reset)
   - Both examples demonstrate correct interpretation as prompt enhancement requests vs wrong interpretation as direct answers

Purpose: Prevent the model from misinterpreting user input as questions in other domains and ensure all input is treated as prompt editing requests.

4. Added confirmation requirement:
   - Added "AUGUST AGENT MODE ACTIVATION" section requiring confirmation statement
   - Modified Output Requirements to mandate starting responses with file confirmation
   - Format: "I confirm I will edit `[filename]` as per your request."

5. Fixed token waste issue:
   - Modified Output Requirements to prevent repeating entire prompt after edits
   - Added instruction to only show specific changed sections if needed
   - Emphasized keeping responses concise and focused on editing actions
