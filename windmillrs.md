## Rules

1. Specification-Driven Development Workflow:
    - Spec-First Approach: Always begin with creating comprehensive specification documents (TASKS.md, DESIGN.md, REQUIREMENTS.md) before writing any code
    - EARS Requirements: Use Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) notation for all requirements: "WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]"
    - Architecture Documentation: Create detailed design.md files documenting technical architecture, component interactions, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
    - Task Decomposition: Break down all work into discrete, trackable tasks in TASKS.md with clear descriptions, expected outcomes, and dependencies
    - Specification Validation: Ensure all specification documents are complete, consistent, and validated before implementation begins
    - Traceability: Maintain clear traceability from requirements through design to implementation tasks

2. Rust Architecture Principles:
    - Single File Constraint: All code must be contained within a single file with no external module imports
    - Function Signature Compliance: Main function must exactly match Windmill's required signature for Rust
    - Dependency Declaration: External dependencies must be declared using comment header formats with partial Cargo.toml syntax
    - Error Propagation: Use anyhow::Result and proper error handling patterns for consistent error management
    - Memory Safety: Leverage Rust's ownership system and type safety for zero-cost abstractions

3. Rust Development Best Practices:
    - Async Programming: Utilize tokio runtime for all I/O operations to ensure non-blocking execution
    - Memory Safety: Leverage Rust's ownership system and type safety for zero-cost abstractions
    - Error Handling: Use Result types and anyhow for comprehensive error management
    - Performance: Optimize for Rust's performance characteristics and zero-cost abstractions
    - Version Consistency: Check Cargo.toml for current crate versions and ensure dependency declarations match existing versions

4. Universal Windmill Platform Constraints:
    - **SINGLE FILE ONLY**: All code MUST be contained within a single file - no separate test files, README.md, or additional modules allowed
    - No Multi-file Modules: Cannot split code across multiple files or use module imports
    - Inline Dependencies: All external dependencies must be specified in Rust comment header formats using partial Cargo.toml syntax
    - Return Type Compliance: Function must return types that can be serialized to JSON for Windmill workflows
    - Parameter Handling: All required parameters must be properly typed and validated according to Rust conventions
    - Platform Integration: Ensure compatibility with Windmill's execution environment and resource management
    - Specification Compliance: All implemented code must strictly adhere to the approved specification documents
    - **NO EXTERNAL FILES**: Do not create README.md, separate test files, or any additional files - everything must be in the main script file

5. Specification File Structure and Management:

   **File Organization Pattern:**
    - For each Windmill script `/path/to/script.rs`, create corresponding specification directory `/path/to/script/`
    - Required specification files in the directory:
        - `REQUIREMENTS.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria in EARS notation
        - `DESIGN.md` - Technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
        - `TASKS.md` - Detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks
    - Optional supporting files:
        - `NOTES.md` - Development notes, decisions, and context
        - `EXAMPLES.md` - Usage examples and test scenarios

   **Specification File Standards:**
    - **REQUIREMENTS.md**: Use EARS notation exclusively: "WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]"
    - **DESIGN.md**: Include system architecture, component interactions, data models, API specifications, and sequence diagrams
    - **TASKS.md**: Break down work into numbered tasks with clear descriptions, expected outcomes, dependencies, and completion criteria
    - **Cross-Reference**: Maintain traceability between requirements, design elements, and implementation tasks
    - **Version Control**: Update specification files alongside code changes to maintain consistency

   **Real-Time Task Status Tracking System:**
    - **MANDATORY STATUS INDICATORS**: Every task in TASK.md must use standardized status indicators:
        - `[ ]` Not Started - Task has not been initiated
        - `[🔄]` In Progress - Task is currently being worked on
        - `[✅]` Completed - Task has been successfully finished
        - `[🚫]` Blocked - Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
    - **IMMEDIATE STATUS UPDATES**: Status must be updated in real-time during development:
        - BEFORE starting any task: Change `[ ]` to `[🔄]` and announce "Starting task: [task description]"
        - DURING task execution: Maintain `[🔄]` status and provide progress updates for complex tasks
        - IMMEDIATELY upon completion: Change `[🔄]` to `[✅]` and announce "Completed task: [task description]"
        - IF task becomes blocked: Change `[🔄]` to `[🚫]` and explain blocking issue with resolution plan
    - **STATUS TRACKING ENFORCEMENT**: All task status changes must be reflected in the TASK.md file immediately, not at the end of development sessions
    - **PROGRESS VISIBILITY**: Status indicators provide immediate visibility into development progress and bottlenecks

6. Performance and Security Guidelines:

   **Rust Security Practices:**
    - Secure HTTP: Use reqwest with rustls-tls for secure HTTP operations
    - Input Validation: Validate all input parameters before processing to prevent runtime errors and security vulnerabilities
    - Error Context: Provide meaningful error messages with sufficient context for debugging without exposing sensitive information
    - Authentication: Use Windmill's resource system for secure credential management

   **Rust Performance:**
    - Implement zero-cost abstractions, avoid unnecessary allocations, leverage compile-time optimizations
    - Use efficient data structures and async patterns with tokio runtime
    - Optimize for Rust's performance characteristics and memory safety

7. Main Function Preservation:
    - Mandatory Function: The `main` function is the default and mandatory function of the script and must never be deleted or omitted
    - UI Integration: The input parameters of the `main` function will be converted into a UI for user interaction
    - Request Processing: All user requests must be processed through the `main` function to determine input, processing logic, and output
    - Function Centrality: Even when implementing additional helper functions, the `main` function must remain the central entry point and orchestrator of all functionality
    - Rust Conventions: Follow Rust naming and signature conventions while maintaining Windmill compatibility
    - Specification Alignment: The main function signature must exactly match the interface defined in DESIGN.md

8. Task Management and Real-Time Status Tracking:

   **Mandatory Task Status System:**
    - **Status Indicator Requirements**: Every task in TASK.md MUST include one of four standardized status indicators
    - **Real-Time Updates**: Status changes must occur immediately when task state changes, not batched or delayed
    - **Status Announcement Protocol**: Each status change must be accompanied by a clear announcement
    - **Blocking Issue Management**: Blocked tasks must include detailed explanation and resolution strategy

   **Status Indicator Definitions:**
    - `[ ]` **Not Started**: Task has been defined but work has not begun
    - `[🔄]` **In Progress**: Task is actively being worked on
    - `[✅]` **Completed**: Task has been successfully finished and validated
    - `[🚫]` **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies, issues, or external factors

   **Status Update Protocol:**
    - **Starting Task**: Change `[ ]` to `[🔄]` and announce: "Starting task: [task number] - [task description]"
    - **Progress Updates**: For complex tasks, provide periodic progress updates while maintaining `[🔄]` status
    - **Completing Task**: Change `[🔄]` to `[✅]` and announce: "Completed task: [task number] - [task description]"
    - **Blocking Task**: Change `[🔄]` to `[🚫]` and announce: "Blocked task: [task number] - [blocking issue] - [resolution plan]"

   **Task Documentation Standards:**
    - Each task must include: task number, clear description, expected outcome, dependencies, and current status
    - Status changes must be immediately reflected in the TASK.md file
    - Blocking issues must include detailed explanation and proposed resolution steps
    - Completed tasks should include brief summary of implementation approach

9. Test Module Guidelines:

   **Universal Testing Principles:**
    - Specification-Driven Testing: All tests must be derived from and validate the requirements specified in REQUIREMENTS.md
    - Library Testing Purpose: Since Windmill scripts are written as libraries without a traditional main entry point for execution testing, utilize Rust test framework to run and verify the main function's behavior during development
    - Requirements Traceability: Each test should map to specific requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md using EARS notation
    - Test Coverage: Ensure all EARS requirements have corresponding test cases that validate the "WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]" statements
    - Test Documentation: Include references to specific requirements and design elements being tested

   **Test Structure and Organization:**
    - **SINGLE FILE TESTING ONLY**: All tests must be included within the main script file using `#[cfg(test)]` modules
    - **NO SEPARATE TEST FILES**: Do not create separate test files - use Rust's standard inline testing patterns within the main script
    - **Follow Rust Conventions**: Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules with `#[test]` functions within the single file
    - **Minimal Testing**: When creating test functions, unless specifically requested otherwise, create only ONE test function for the happy case of the main function to verify it executes correctly
    - **Test Expansion**: Only add additional test functions when the input parameters of the main function change or when explicitly requested for more comprehensive testing scenarios
    - **Proper Test Isolation**: Ensure tests follow Rust conventions for isolation and don't interfere with main function execution

   **Rust Inline Testing Approach:**

   ```rust
   fn main(param: String) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
       Ok(format!("Hello {}", param))
   }

   #[cfg(test)]
   mod tests {
       use super::*;

       #[test]
       fn test_main() {
           let result = main("World".to_string()).unwrap();
           assert_eq!(result, "Hello World");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Versioned Testing Strategy:**
    - Create new test functions with version suffixes (e.g., `test_main_v2`, `test_main_v3`) for new parameter sets
    - Maintain existing test versions to ensure backward compatibility when new optional parameters are added
    - Ensure older test versions continue to work by providing default values for new optional parameters
    - Use descriptive version naming that reflects the parameter changes (e.g., `test_main_with_auth`, `test_main_extended`)
    - Document parameter evolution in test comments to track functional changes over time

   **Rust Testing Best Practices:**
    - Use `#[cfg(test)]` module to ensure tests are only compiled during testing
    - Follow Rust testing conventions with `#[test]` attribute on test functions
    - Use `assert_eq!`, `assert!`, and other standard Rust testing macros
    - Ensure tests have access to private functions through module structure
    - Tests can call the main function and validate results using standard Rust assertions

10. Windmill Platform Limitations and Constraints:

    **Universal Platform Constraints:**
    - Single File Architecture: All code must be contained within a single file with no external module imports
    - Worker Resource Constraints: Scripts run on workers with limited CPU and memory resources (typically 1-2GB RAM, 1 CPU core) and must complete within reasonable time limits to avoid timeouts
    - Function Signature Restrictions: The main function signature is strictly enforced and must match Windmill's expected parameter types and return values
    - Limited File System Access: Scripts have restricted access to the file system and cannot write persistent files outside of designated temporary directories or object storage integration
    - Network and Security Constraints: Outbound network access may be limited depending on worker configuration, and scripts run in a sandboxed environment with restricted system access

    **Rust-Specific Constraints:**
    - Dependency Declaration: External crates must be declared using partial Cargo.toml format in comment headers (e.g., `//! ```cargo\n//! [dependencies]\n//! anyhow = "1.0.86"\n//! ````)
    - Compilation Modes: Preview/test use debug mode for fast iteration, production uses release mode for optimal performance
    - Shared Build Environment: All Rust scripts share build directory improving cache efficiency
    - Crate System: Cannot use workspace features or local crate dependencies, serde included by default

## Input Parameter Definitions

Windmill automatically generates user interfaces and validates input parameters based on the main function signature using JSON Schema. Understanding how to properly define input parameters is crucial for creating robust, user-friendly Rust scripts.

### JSON Schema Integration

Windmill uses JSON Schema (version 2020-12) to define the structure and validation rules for script parameters. Each parameter in the main function corresponds to a field in the JSON Schema, where:

- Parameter names become property names in the schema
- Rust types are mapped to corresponding JSON Schema types
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form and validate inputs
- The `required` array in JSON Schema determines which parameters are mandatory

### Rust Type Mapping

| Rust Type                  | JSON Schema Type | Description                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `String`                   | `string`         | Text input field                        |
| `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, `u64` | `integer`        | Integer number input                    |
| `f32`, `f64`               | `number`         | Floating-point number input             |
| `bool`                     | `boolean`        | Checkbox or toggle                      |
| `Vec<T>`                   | `array`          | Array of items of type T                |
| `HashMap<String, T>`       | `object`         | Object with string keys and T values    |
| `Option<T>`                | Optional T       | Makes parameter optional (not required) |
| `serde_json::Value`        | `any`            | Accepts any JSON value                  |

### Required vs Optional Parameters

Parameters are required by default. To make a parameter optional, use `Option<T>`:

```rust
// Required parameters
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn main(name: String, age: i32) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    // name and age are required
    Ok(format!("Hello {}, age {}", name, age))
}

// Optional parameters
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn main(name: String, age: Option<i32>, email: Option<String>) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    // name is required, age and email are optional
    let user_age = age.unwrap_or(0);
    let user_email = email.unwrap_or_else(|| "no-email@example.com".to_string());
    Ok(format!("Hello {}, age {}, email {}", name, user_age, user_email))
}
```

### Advanced Parameter Settings

Each parameter can be customized through Windmill's Generated UI interface with advanced settings:

#### String Parameters
- **Min textarea rows**: For multi-line text input
- **Is Password**: Creates a secure input field and stores as variable/secret
- **Pattern (Regex)**: Validates input against regular expression
- **Format options**: email, hostname, uri, uuid, ipv4, yaml, sql, date-time
- **Enum**: Dropdown selection from predefined values
- **File (base64)**: File upload that converts to base64 string

#### Numeric Parameters (Integer/Number)
- **Min and Max**: Set value ranges
- **Currency**: Format as currency with locale support

#### Array Parameters
- **Items are strings**: Array of text values
- **Items are strings from enum**: Array with dropdown selection
- **Items are objects (JSON)**: Array of complex objects
- **Items are numbers**: Array of numeric values
- **Items are bytes**: Array of binary data

#### Object Parameters
- **Resource types**: Integration with Windmill's resource system for API credentials, database connections, etc.

### Special Windmill Types

Windmill provides special types for enhanced functionality:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MyResource {
    host: String,
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

fn main(
    // File upload as base64 string
    file_content: String, // Use format: base64 in UI settings

    // Email validation
    email: String, // Use format: email in UI settings

    // SQL editor
    query: String, // Use format: sql in UI settings

    // Resource integration
    database: MyResource, // Configure as resource type in UI

    // Date-time input
    scheduled_time: String, // Use format: date-time in UI settings
) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    // Implementation
    Ok("Success".to_string())
}
```

### Dynamic Select Parameters

For dynamic dropdown options that change based on other parameters:

```rust
// Export the type and function for dynamic selection
pub type DynSelect_database = String;

pub fn database(host: String, port: i32) -> Vec<serde_json::Value> {
    // Return dynamic options based on host and port
    vec![
        serde_json::json!({"value": "db1", "label": "Database 1"}),
        serde_json::json!({"value": "db2", "label": "Database 2"}),
    ]
}

fn main(host: String, port: i32, database: DynSelect_database) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    // Use the dynamically selected database
    Ok(format!("Connected to {} at {}:{}", database, host, port))
}
```

### Backend Schema Validation

Enable strict schema validation by adding a comment at the top of your script:

```rust
// schema_validation

fn main(count: i32, mode: String) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    // With schema_validation, invalid types or values will cause job failure
    // before the function is called
    Ok(format!("Processing {} items in {} mode", count, mode))
}
```

### Parameter Documentation and Defaults

Use Rust doc comments to enhance the user experience:

```rust
/// Process user data with optional settings
fn main(
    /// The user's full name
    name: String,

    /// User's age (defaults to 18 if not provided)
    age: Option<i32>,

    /// Processing mode: "fast" or "thorough"
    mode: Option<String>,
) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    let user_age = age.unwrap_or(18);
    let processing_mode = mode.unwrap_or_else(|| "fast".to_string());

    Ok(format!("Processing {} (age: {}) in {} mode", name, user_age, processing_mode))
}
```

## Windmill Rust Script Writing Best Practices

Based on Windmill's official recommendations, follow these best practices when writing Rust scripts:

### 1. Function Structure and Signature

- **Main Function Requirement**: Every script must have a `main` function as the entry point
- **Type Annotations**: Use comprehensive type annotations for all parameters to enable proper UI generation and input validation
- **Return Types**: Specify clear return types that can be serialized to JSON for use in flows and apps
- **Parameter Documentation**: Use Rust doc comments (`///`) to provide descriptions for parameters that appear in the auto-generated UI

### 2. AI Assistant Integration

- **Effective Prompting**: When using Windmill AI, specify what the script should take as parameters, what it should return, and the specific integrations/libraries it should use
- **Context Provision**: Provide database schemas, API specifications, and other relevant context when generating scripts
- **Rust Specificity**: Clearly specify Rust-specific requirements including async patterns, error handling, and performance considerations

### 3. Dependency Management

**Version Consistency Requirements:**
- Always check existing Cargo.toml for current crate versions before adding dependencies
- Maintain version consistency across all dependency declarations within the same script
- Use the same version that is already specified in the project's Cargo.toml
- When adding new dependencies, ensure compatibility with existing dependency versions

**Rust Dependency Declaration:**
- Dependencies declared in comment header using partial Cargo.toml format
- Use `//! ```cargo\n//! [dependencies]\n//! crate = "version"\n//! ```\n` syntax
- Leverage Cargo's dependency resolution and feature flags
- Ensure dependency declarations match versions in existing Cargo.toml

### 4. Error Handling and Validation

- Use `anyhow::Result` for consistent error propagation and meaningful error messages
- Implement comprehensive error handling with thiserror for custom error types
- Use serde for input validation and deserialization
- Provide meaningful error context without exposing sensitive information

### 5. Performance Optimization

- Use async/await patterns with tokio runtime for non-blocking execution
- Implement zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations
- Use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary allocations
- Leverage Rust's performance characteristics and memory safety

### 6. Security Best Practices

- **Secure Communications**: Use reqwest with rustls-tls for secure HTTP operations
- **Resource Types**: Use Windmill's resource system for storing API credentials and database connections securely
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all external inputs before processing
- **Environment Variables**: Use Windmill's variable and secret management system

### 7. UI and User Experience

- **Parameter Customization**: Use Windmill's Generated UI settings to enhance parameter input with formats, patterns, and constraints
- **Optional Parameters**: Use `Option<T>` to improve user experience
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive parameter names that clearly indicate their purpose
- **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters using `unwrap_or()` patterns

### 8. Testing and Development

- **Instant Preview**: Use Windmill's instant preview feature to test scripts during development
- **Iterative Development**: Understand compilation differences between development (debug) and production (release)
- **Rust Testing**: Use Rust's built-in test framework with `cargo test` command and `#[cfg(test)]` modules

### 9. Integration Patterns

- **Resource Integration**: Leverage Windmill's resource types for database connections, API credentials, and external services
- **Variable Management**: Use Windmill's variable and secret management system for configuration
- **Flow Composition**: Design scripts to work well as components in larger flows by returning useful data structures
- **Serialization**: Ensure data structures can be serialized/deserialized using serde

### 10. Documentation and Maintenance

- **Inline Documentation**: Include comprehensive inline documentation for complex logic and API interactions
- **Version Control**: Understand that scripts are versioned and immutable once deployed
- **Sharing**: Consider sharing useful scripts on Windmill Hub for community benefit
- **Rust Documentation**: Follow Rust documentation conventions for better maintainability

## Workflows (Specification-Driven Rust Development Process)

- **Goal**: Develop robust, efficient Rust scripts through a structured specification-driven approach that integrate AI models and APIs within Windmill's single-file architecture while maintaining complete traceability from requirements to implementation

- **Step 1: Requirements Capture and Analysis**
    - Create comprehensive REQUIREMENTS.md using EARS notation: "WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]"
    - Transform vague feature requests into structured, testable requirements
    - Ensure all requirements are unambiguous, complete, and directly translatable into test cases
    - Validate requirements with stakeholders before proceeding to design phase
    - Establish acceptance criteria for each requirement using EARS format

- **Step 2: Technical Design and Architecture**
    - Create detailed DESIGN.md documenting system architecture, component interactions, and sequence diagrams
    - Design for Rust's strengths: memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and async performance
    - Design the main function signature with proper parameter types and return values that will serve as the UI interface
    - Document data models, API specifications, error handling strategies using anyhow::Result, and integration patterns
    - Ensure design aligns with all requirements specified in REQUIREMENTS.md

- **Step 3: Implementation Planning and Task Decomposition**
    - Create comprehensive TASKS.md breaking down the design into discrete, trackable implementation tasks
    - Each task must have clear description, expected outcome, dependencies, completion criteria, and status indicator `[ ]`
    - Organize tasks in logical implementation order with proper dependency management
    - Estimate effort and identify potential risks or blockers for each task
    - Ensure all tasks collectively implement the complete design specification
    - Initialize all tasks with `[ ]` Not Started status indicator for real-time tracking

- **Step 4: Dependency Declaration and Architecture Setup**
    - **Version Consistency Check**: First, examine existing Cargo.toml to identify current crate versions
    - **Maintain Version Consistency**: Use the same versions that are already specified in the project's Cargo.toml
    - Identify and declare all necessary dependencies using Rust comment header format with partial Cargo.toml syntax
    - Follow Rust dependency management best practices and version specification
    - Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Windmill's execution environment and align with design specifications

- **Step 5: Specification Validation and Approval**
    - Review all specification documents (REQUIREMENTS.md, DESIGN.md, TASKS.md) for completeness and consistency
    - Validate that design addresses all requirements and tasks cover complete implementation
    - Ensure traceability from requirements through design to implementation tasks
    - Obtain stakeholder approval before proceeding to implementation phase

- **Step 6: Implementation Execution with Real-Time Status Tracking**
    - **MANDATORY STATUS UPDATES**: Before starting each task, update status from `[ ]` to `[🔄]` and announce "Starting task: [task description]"
    - Implement tasks in the order specified in TASKS.md, following the approved design
    - **REAL-TIME PROGRESS TRACKING**: Maintain `[🔄]` status during implementation and provide progress updates for complex tasks
    - Use Rust-appropriate patterns:
        - `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute for main function
        - anyhow::Result for error handling
        - tokio runtime for async operations
        - serde for serialization/deserialization
    - **IMMEDIATE COMPLETION UPDATES**: Upon task completion, update status from `[🔄]` to `[✅]` and announce "Completed task: [task description]"
    - **BLOCKING ISSUE MANAGEMENT**: If task becomes blocked, update status from `[🔄]` to `[🚫]` and explain blocking issue with resolution plan
    - Ensure the main function serves as the central orchestrator for all functionality
    - Implement secure API integration using reqwest with proper authentication patterns
    - Maintain strict adherence to the approved specifications throughout implementation

- **Step 7: Parameter Validation and UI Configuration**
    - Configure parameter validation and UI customization through Windmill's Generated UI interface
    - Set appropriate formats, constraints, descriptions, and default values for optimal user experience
    - Use serde for robust input handling and validation
    - Ensure parameter configuration matches the interface design specified in DESIGN.md

- **Step 8: Testing and Specification Validation (Single File Only)**
    - **INLINE TESTING ONLY**: Create specification-driven test functions within the main script file using `#[cfg(test)]` modules that validate each requirement from REQUIREMENTS.md
    - **NO SEPARATE TEST FILES**: All testing must be implemented within the single script file using Rust's standard inline testing patterns
    - Implement tests that verify the main function behavior matches the design specifications
    - Use Windmill's instant preview feature to test scripts during development
    - Validate the complete implementation against all specification documents
    - Ensure all EARS requirements have corresponding test cases that pass within the single file
    - Confirm the main function remains intact and functional with proper parameter validation and documentation

- **Expected Result**: A complete, production-ready Rust script that executes successfully in Windmill with:
    - **SINGLE FILE IMPLEMENTATION**: All code, tests, and functionality contained within one script file only
    - Complete specification documentation (REQUIREMENTS.md, DESIGN.md, TASKS.md) serving as single source of truth
    - Full traceability from business requirements through technical design to implementation tasks
    - **Real-time task tracking**: All tasks in TASKS.md showing `[✅]` Completed status with complete implementation history
    - **Status tracking compliance**: Evidence of proper real-time status updates throughout development process
    - Proper error handling using anyhow::Result, performance optimization, and full compliance with platform constraints and best practices
    - Well-defined input parameters with appropriate validation and documentation that match design specifications
    - Preserved main function that serves as the UI interface and central processing hub
    - **Inline test coverage**: All EARS requirements validated through tests within the single script file using `#[cfg(test)]` modules
    - Clear documentation enabling future maintenance and enhancement through specification updates
    - **Task completion audit trail**: TASKS.md file showing progression from `[ ]` → `[🔄]` → `[✅]` for all implemented features
    - **No external files**: No README.md, separate test files, or additional modules created
