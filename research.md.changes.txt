   - Enhanced Core Protocol in Initialization to include mandatory verification of certainty before proceeding
   - Added "Data Safety Imperative" to Initialization emphasizing search requirement for uncertain information
   - Enhanced final commitment to include absolute prohibition on answering when uncertain or lacking verified information

6. Added search frequency and perspective balance protocol:
   - Added "Search Frequency and Perspective Balance Protocol" to Mandatory Research Protocols requiring opposing perspective searches after repeated topic searches
   - Specified that when searching for the same topic more than 3 times, for every 3 additional searches on that topic, one additional search from an opposing or alternative perspective must be conducted
   - Designed to ensure balanced information gathering and prevent confirmation bias during extensive research on the same topic

7. Added comprehensive source diversification and bias prevention mechanisms:
   - Added "Source Diversification Imperative" requiring multiple independent, geographically and organizationally diverse sources to prevent data concentration bias
   - Added "Geographic Source Distribution Protocol" mandating sources from different geographic regions and cultural contexts
   - Added "Institutional Independence Verification" requiring verification that sources are institutionally independent from each other
   - Added "Single-Source Information Prohibition" absolutely forbidding presentation of information from only one source as verified or reliable
   - Enhanced "Level-Appropriate Verification" standards: Level 1 requires minimum two independent sources from different organizations, Level 2 requires minimum three from different geographic regions, Level 3 requires minimum four with verified institutional independence
   - Added "Source Independence Audit Protocol" requiring systematic review to ensure all supporting sources are genuinely independent and not part of the same information ecosystem
   - Enhanced source credibility assessment to include geographic origin and organizational independence evaluation
   - Updated misinformation detection to exclude information clusters from affiliated sources
   - Enhanced sensitive topic protocol to include mandatory cross-regional source validation

8. Enhanced search query optimization to prevent automatic time appending:
   - Added "Search Query Optimization" to Advanced Web Research Mastery skills requiring natural language search terms without automatically appending time indicators
   - Updated "Temporal Context Imperative" in Mandatory Research Protocols to specify prohibition on automatically appending time indicators (e.g., 2024, 2025) unless specifically requested by user
   - Enhanced "Web-First Imperative" to clarify using natural search terms without automatically appending time indicators unless specifically requested by user
   - Updated Level 1 Workflow to specify conducting searches without automatically appending time indicators unless specifically requested by user
   - Enhanced Core Protocol in Initialization to specify web-first approach using natural search terms without automatically appending time indicators unless user specifically requests temporal constraints
   - Designed to prevent unnecessary temporal constraints in search queries that could limit relevant results unless temporal context is specifically needed

9. Added Anti-Lazy Task Creation & Enhanced Data Security Protocol:
   - Added comprehensive new "Anti-Lazy Task Creation & Enhanced Data Security Protocol" section (Rule 7) to address lazy task creation and insufficient data security perspectives
   - Added "Comprehensive Perspective Mandate" requiring coverage of ALL relevant stakeholder perspectives including technical, economic, social, legal, ethical, environmental, historical, future, and opposing viewpoints
   - Added "Multi-Dimensional Security Analysis Requirement" mandating dedicated tasks for data privacy, cybersecurity, information security risks, misuse scenarios, regulatory compliance, ethical data handling, transparency obligations, and stakeholder protection
   - Added "Adversarial Perspective Integration" requiring mandatory inclusion of tasks examining negative consequences, failure modes, security vulnerabilities, misuse scenarios, unintended consequences, and critical opposing viewpoints
   - Added "Depth Escalation Protocol" requiring each primary task to have follow-up tasks that drill deeper, explore edge cases, examine implementation challenges, assess long-term implications, and investigate complications
   - Added "Cross-Domain Impact Assessment" requiring tasks examining intersections with other domains, ripple effects, interdependencies, systemic implications, and broader ecosystem impacts
   - Added "Temporal Security Analysis" requiring examination of both current security posture and future security implications, emerging threats, evolving regulatory landscapes, and long-term sustainability
   - Added "Stakeholder Vulnerability Assessment" requiring specific examination of how different stakeholder groups might be affected by security and privacy implications, with attention to power imbalances and exploitation scenarios
   - Added "Implementation Reality Check" requiring tasks examining practical implementation challenges, resource requirements, technical limitations, organizational barriers, and real-world constraints

   - Updated Level 3 Workflow to include mandatory application of Anti-Lazy Task Creation Protocol with validation requirements and security-first prioritization
   - Enhanced Core Protocol in Initialization to reference Anti-Lazy Task Creation Protocol ensuring all stakeholder perspectives, security/privacy implications, adversarial viewpoints, and cross-domain impacts are addressed
   - Enhanced final commitment to include comprehensive task creation using Anti-Lazy Task Creation Protocol with all required perspectives and security considerations
   - Renumbered subsequent sections to maintain proper sequence (sections 8-14)
   - Designed to prevent superficial task creation and ensure thorough examination of data security, privacy implications, and comprehensive stakeholder perspectives in all Level 3 research
