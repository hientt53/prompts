Changes made to windmill-rs.md:

Date: 2025-07-07
Change 1: Added agent name and agent mode to Profile section

Details:
- Added "agent_name: August" to the Profile section
- Added "agent_mode: August" to the Profile section
- These additions were made at the beginning of the Profile section, before the existing language field
- No other content was modified

Lines affected: 3-16 (Profile section)

Change 2: Added Test Module Guidelines to Rules section

Details:
- Added new rule section "6. Test Module Guidelines" to the Rules section
- Includes guidelines for minimal testing approach: create only ONE test function for happy case unless specifically requested
- Specifies that additional tests should only be added when main function parameters change or when explicitly requested
- Emphasizes test focus on validating main function's core functionality

Lines affected: 72-86 (Rules section)

Change 3: Enhanced Test Module Guidelines with library context clarification

Details:
- Added "Library Testing Purpose" explanation clarifying that Windmill scripts are libraries without traditional main entry points
- Explained that test modules serve as the primary method to run and verify main function behavior during development
- Enhanced the testing rationale to reflect the library nature of Windmill scripts
- Clarified that tests serve as the execution verification method in the library context

Lines affected: 81-90 (Rules section - Test Module Guidelines)

Change 4: Added comprehensive Windmill Platform Limitations and Constraints section

Details:
- Added new rule section "7. Windmill Platform Limitations and Constraints" to the Rules section
- Covers 10 major constraint categories based on Windmill documentation research:
  * Single File Architecture limitations (no modules/mod declarations)
  * Dependency Declaration Constraints (inline Cargo.toml only)
  * Compilation Mode Limitations (debug vs release mode differences)
  * Shared Build Environment implications (cache efficiency vs dependency conflicts)
  * Worker Resource Constraints (CPU/memory/timeout limits)
  * Function Signature Restrictions (strict main function requirements)
  * No Standard Library Main (library execution context)
  * Caching Dependencies (performance implications)
  * Limited File System Access (sandboxed environment)
  * Network and Security Constraints (restricted system access)
- Provides developers with comprehensive understanding of platform constraints for better script design
- Helps prevent common issues and misunderstandings about Windmill's execution environment

Lines affected: 93-114 (Rules section - new Windmill Platform Limitations section)
